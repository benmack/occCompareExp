``occCompareExp`` has been used for producing the results for the paper

Mack, B., Waske, B. (2017): In-depth comparisons of MaxEnt, biased SVM and one-class SVM for one-class classification of remote sensing data. Remote Sensing Letters 8, 290â€“299. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2016.1265689.

It depends on the packages [**occCompare**](https://github.com/benmack/occCompare) and [**oneClass**](https://github.com/benmack/oneClass).

As an example, it can be useful for understanding how to set up the user-defined functions required for using [**occCompare**](https://github.com/benmack/occCompare) and how to set up the experiments.
