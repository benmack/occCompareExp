``occCompareExp`` has been used for producing the results for the manuscript (submitted to *Remote Sensing Letters*)

	In-depth comparisons of MaxEnt, biased SVM and one-class SVM for one-class classification of remote sensing data.

It depends on the packages [**occCompare**](https://github.com/benmack/occCompare) and [**oneClass**](https://github.com/benmack/oneClass).

As an example, it can be useful for understanding how to set up the user-defined functions required for using [**occCompare**](https://github.com/benmack/occCompare) and how to set up the experiments.
